- all non-v2.0 specs
- gemify : http://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/

PATH TO 1.5
---
- ERB/html generator
- "list" filters/queries
- comments
- clean up issue=.  maybe create a magic hash class that does field validation and changelog in []  
   (or is that what Issue is supposed to be doing?)

---------

TODO:
- store schema version in each issue
- query by status
- arguments to 'new': taco new component:foo kind:bar summary:'ick thud wank'
- simplified editing: taco edit 123abc summary:'change only this one field'
- should taco config and issues go into different directories?

- fully interactive mode (shell)

- don't bypass commander's exception handler, fix it and use it.
  - fix problems with commander and send patch to owner (clone to taco until gem suffices)

- dsl for attributes: attr :id, :class => String, :required => true, :settable => false
                      => creates setter/getter and validators
                      perhaps a different dsl for taco vs user attrs: id vs kind

- some way of constraining Change :attribute to Issue::SCHEMA_ATTRIBUTES

- don't report validation problems one at a time, report all of them at once
- user-specified Issue attributes via .tacorc
