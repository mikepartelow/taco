BUGS
---
- why do the specs print out "invalid command"? is it because i removed the __FILE__==$0?
- git tag as part of "rake release"
- smarter rake release: check latest version on rubygems and don't allow version numbers below that
                        have an interactive mode instead of [1.2.3]
                        gem list -r taco_it -a
- FIXMEs
- taco show: changelog is upside down ;)
                        
FEATURES
---
- case insensitive searching

- Issue.set_allowed_values! should also alter SCHEMA_ATTRIBUTES[:x][:default] (and be renamed)

- jquery tablesorter for index.html

- move default RC to defaults dir

- user-specifiable (via .tacorc and CL switches) column list for "taco list"
- user-specifiable (via .tacorc and CL switches) sort order for "taco list"

- make priority part of default sort order
- CHANGELOG file
- comments
- ri/rdoc
- clean up issue=.  maybe create a magic hash class that does field validation and changelog in []  
   (or is that what Issue is supposed to be doing?)
- 4.0 on codeclimate
- don't report validation problems one at a time, report all of them at once
- user-specified Issue attributes via .tacorc
- Text vs. String type: one has newlines, the other doesn't
- bash completion: http://fahdshariff.blogspot.com/2011/04/writing-your-own-bash-completion.html

  - can we do something neat like generate and source it as part of init?  will have to re-source it for each new term session

- bulk editing: taco edit -a or taco edit kind:Defect
- jquery tablesorter has a really nice github README
---------

TODO:
- store schema version in each issue
- arguments to 'new': taco new component:foo kind:bar summary:'ick thud wank'
- simplified editing: taco edit 123abc summary:'change only this one field'
- should taco config and issues go into different directories?

- fully interactive mode (shell)

- don't bypass commander's exception handler, fix it and use it.
  - fix problems with commander and send patch to owner (clone to taco until gem suffices)

- dsl for attributes: attr :id, :class => String, :required => true, :settable => false
                      => creates setter/getter and validators
                      perhaps a different dsl for taco vs user attrs: id vs kind

- some way of constraining Change :attribute to Issue::SCHEMA_ATTRIBUTES
