BUGS IN 1.0.0
---
- BLOCKER: bug when editing multi-line description.  (165c55d07c38413da35592b5db6fcab7)
- edit screen is a little cramped (maybe description should have a bottom --- delimiter?)
- long descriptions look ugly in changelog
- why do the specs print out "invalid command"? is it because i removed the __FILE__==$0?

PATH TO 1.1
---
- CHANGELOG file
- script that: changes version in taco.rb, changes version in taco.gemspec, builds the gem
- "list" filters/queries
- priority

PATH TO 1.2
---
- comments
- ri/rdoc
- ERB/html generator
- clean up issue=.  maybe create a magic hash class that does field validation and changelog in []  
   (or is that what Issue is supposed to be doing?)
- 4.0 on codeclimate

---------

TODO:
- store schema version in each issue
- query by status
- arguments to 'new': taco new component:foo kind:bar summary:'ick thud wank'
- simplified editing: taco edit 123abc summary:'change only this one field'
- should taco config and issues go into different directories?

- fully interactive mode (shell)

- don't bypass commander's exception handler, fix it and use it.
  - fix problems with commander and send patch to owner (clone to taco until gem suffices)

- dsl for attributes: attr :id, :class => String, :required => true, :settable => false
                      => creates setter/getter and validators
                      perhaps a different dsl for taco vs user attrs: id vs kind

- some way of constraining Change :attribute to Issue::SCHEMA_ATTRIBUTES

- don't report validation problems one at a time, report all of them at once
- user-specified Issue attributes via .tacorc
