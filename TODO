BUGS
---
- taco push prints out "true"
- why do the specs print out "invalid command"? is it because i removed the __FILE__==$0?
- git tag as part of "rake release"
- smarter rake release: check latest version on rubygems and don't allow version numbers below that
                        have an interactive mode instead of [1.2.3]
                        gem list -r taco_it -a
- FIXMEs
- taco show: changelog is upside down ;)
                        
FEATURES
---
-  sort in either direction with - (-short_id vs short_id)
- specs combining list sorting and filtering
- user-specifiable (via .tacorc and CL switches) sort order for "taco list"
- user-specifiable (via .tacorc and CL switches) column list for "taco list"
- user-specifiable via .tacorc default filter
  - consider MERGING default filter with cmdline.  ex: .tacorc: user:mike, "taco list status:open" should show mike's open, NOT all open
  - consider printing filter unless squelched
  - per-user .tacorc. OR: .tacorc is the repo conf, taco_profile is the per-user
    - taco_profile should be multi-repos:
      work_bugs:
      sort: user,priority
      cols: created_at,id,priority
      todo_list:
      sort: priority,summary
      cols: priority,summary,created_at

- don't report validation problems one at a time, report all of them at once

- jquery tablesorter for index.html

  - can we do something neat like generate and source it as part of init?  will have to re-source it for each new term session

- bulk editing: taco edit -a or taco edit kind:Defect
- jquery tablesorter has a really nice github README
---------

TODO:
- store schema version in each issue
- arguments to 'new': taco new component:foo kind:bar summary:'ick thud wank'
- simplified editing: taco edit 123abc summary:'change only this one field'
- should taco config and issues go into different directories?

- fully interactive mode (shell)

- don't bypass commander's exception handler, fix it and use it.
  - fix problems with commander and send patch to owner (clone to taco until gem suffices)
